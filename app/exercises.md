     words = "apple, banana, cherry, date"
     search_word = "banana"

     **Output:**  
     ```
     "yes"

7. **Square and Cube**  
   - Write a program that asks for a number `n` and calculates the square and cube of each number from 1 to `n`.  
   - **Example:**  
     **Input:**  
     ```
     3
     ```  
     **Output:**  
     ```
     1^2 = 1, 1^3 = 1
     2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8
     3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27
     ```

8. **Inverted Pyramid**  
   - Create a program that prints an inverted pyramid of asterisks, with a height `n` entered by the user.  
   - **Example:**  
     If `n = 3`  
     **Input:**  
     ```
     3
     ```

     ***  
     **  
     *  
     ```

9. **Reverse a Word**

   - **Example:**  
     **Input:**  
     ```
     "hello"
     ```  
     **Output:**  
     ```
     "olleh"
     ```

10. **Multiples of a Number**  
    - Create a program that asks for an integer `n` and generates a list with the first `n` multiples of another number `m` that the user must also enter.  
    - **Example:**  
      **Input:**  
      ```
      n = 5
      m = 3
      ```
